# AI Notes for Docs

- Prioritize readability and short how-to steps.
- Cross-link to playbooks and inventory files.
- Keep topology and structure docs synchronized with repository changes.
- Reinforce that Ansible artifacts should use `.yaml` by default, with `ansible.cfg` as the expected exception.
- Reinforce use of `ansible.builtin.raw` on managed routers/devices where Python may not be installed.
